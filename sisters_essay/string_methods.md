# Instructions

In this exercise, you are helping your younger sister edit her paper for school. The teacher is looking for correct punctuation, grammar, and excellent word choice.

You have four tasks to clean up and modify strings.

## Task 1

### Capitalize the title of the paper

Any good paper needs a properly formatted title.
Implement the function **capitalize_title(<title>)** which takes a title **str** as a parameter and capitalizes the first letter of each word. This function should return a **str** in title case.

## Task 2

### Check if each sentence ends with a period

You want to make sure that the punctuation in the paper is perfect. Implement the function **check_sentence_ending()** that takes **sentence** as a parameter. This function should return a **bool**.

## Task 3

### Clean up spacing

To make the paper look professional, unnecessary spacing needs to be removed. Implement the function **clean_up_spacing()** that takes **sentence** as a parameter. The function should remove extra whitespace at both the beginning and the end of the sentence, returning a new, updated sentence **str**.

# Instructions

In this exercise, you are helping your younger sister edit her paper for school. The teacher is looking for correct punctuation, grammar, and excellent word choice.

You have four tasks to clean up and modify strings.

## Task 1

### Capitalize the title of the paper

Any good paper needs a properly formatted title.
Implement the function **capitalize_title(<title>)** which takes a title **str** as a parameter and capitalizes the first letter of each word. This function should return a **str** in title case.
